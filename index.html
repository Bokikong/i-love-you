                        <strong>To my pookie.</strong>
                        <p>
                            Today, on your birthday, I find myself at a loss for words, not because I dont have anything to say, but because no words could ever fully capture how much you mean to me. Still, I will try, because you deserve every bit of love I can express and more.</p>

<p>From the moment we met, I knew there was something special about you. Your smile, your laugh, the way your eyes light up when you're happy amd the vibe yk especially nung first hang out with u sa intra I was comfortable around you alr and its as if the world becomes a little brighter just kase you’re in it. You are not only beautiful on the outside, but your heart is a treasure that I am lucky enough to know.</p>

<p>Every day that I spend talking with you is a gift, and I will never take that for granted. You make even the simplest moments feel magical. Whether we’re talking about our dreams, talking shit to each other, or just enjoying the silence together lalo na sa dc, everything feels more meaningful when I'm with you. Its as though the universe itself wanted us to find each other, and I'm endlessly grateful it did.</p>

<p>On this special day, I want to remind you of how much you are loved and not just by me, but by all those whose lives you've touched which you will meet later. You inspire me in ways I never knew were possible. You make me want to be a better person, to work harder, to laugh more, and to love without fear or limits. You make me do things that I never do to other people such as opening my heart fully and making me feel comfy around you, on my ups and downs you are always there for me, my one call away when things go down and my only reason for me to keep pushing in this hell of a life. You are my home, my heart, and the one I want to share all my tomorrows with.</p>

<p>As you celebrate another year of life, know that I am here, as I always will be, loving you more with every passing moment. I hope this birthday is filled with everything that brings you joy, just as you bring so much joy into my life.

<p>Happy birthday, my love. Here’s to many more birthdays, and many more beautiful memories that we’ll create together. I love you endlessly and always will.</p>

<p>I love you with all my heart</p>

<p>Sincerely,
your nigga</p>
